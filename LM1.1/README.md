## LM1.1 Computer Science Impact Reflection (50 pts)

I know this is a CS class, but you are going to stretch your intellectual minds and use some communication skills to reflect on how technology and computer science interacts with world.

You are going to write a reflection paper, no longer than a single page (single space, 10 or 12 pt normal font). Make sure I can open it! (.docx, .pdf, or .md)

I want three sections:

1. Discuss one positive change to society from software
2. Discuss one negative change to society from software
3. What you would want software to transform from your perspective/worldview/faith? I want to hear about how you would connect your passions and perspective to writing code and hear what kinds of things you might want to make or see someone else making.
4. Consider the software you discussed in question #3. How important is having a diverse team of people contributing to the development of that software?



This will be graded as complete/incomplete, but I do expect thoughtful responses. If I feel you did not put effort, I will ask you to re-do it. I am not grading for grammar or spelling, I am grading for content.
